      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently a FullStack web Development Fellow at Pursuit which is an
        intensive 12 month FullStack web development fellowship where I am
        upskilling/ reskilling to break into tech. I have always been the person
        who loves solving complex problems and breaking them down. Since I have
        always been an avid lifelong learner, Software Engineering felt like the
        next natural and logical step career-wise. Prior to this, I have
        experiences in various roles all in one way or another that involve
        Operations Management, whether its my recent experience as a warehouse
        operations lead where I was in charge of both day to day operations as
        well as personnel management. I have worn many hats in this role such as
        customer service support, vendor management, delivery partners
        management and logistics management among many others. Looking back on
        my past work experiences, I have demonstrated an agile and quick
        adaptability to new roles and industries while successfully exceeding
        expectations. I am excited to begin my career pivot into tech and put my
        new skills to use. I hope to deepen my understanding of both existing
        and emerging technologies as a software engineer in my future role. My
        fellowship will give me the opportunity to gain invaluable experience in
        the field, and I look forward to using that knowledge to make a positive
        impact on the industry. By collaborating with others on innovative
        projects, I know that I can contribute value and help shape the future
        of technology.

      <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I ever came across was this infinite loop I couldn't
        escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came up with a totally sick solution though by doing code block tests
